        <p>
            My name is Arshia. I live in Newport Beach with my beautiful wife and 7-month-old baby daughter. I am a Southern California
            native, born and raised. Being from So-Cal obviously means I am a huge Laker’s fan. I love all things technology,
            currently I am learning how to code. Presently I am working at an aerospace manufacturing company, located in
            Long Beach, as the IT Manager. I really enjoy travelling whenever I can, my favorite destination was Thailand.
            My wife and I visited in 2014 where I proposed, got to see the most beautiful islands, and got bit by monkey.
            It was a very memorable trip. This is my first full coding project that involves HTML and CSS. My coding journey
            only began a month ago, but I am really enjoying the challenge every day. More coding experience coming soon,
            thanks for visiting.
